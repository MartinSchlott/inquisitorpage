# Content Management

## Core Principles
- Markdown-based content with metadata sections
- Language-specific content trees
- Tag and category system
- Open Graph image support

## Content Structure
- Content files in Markdown with metadata sections (DOC-META, SEC-META)
- Language-specific default OG images defined in languages.json
- Pages without DOC-META fall back to language header title and default image
- Clear hierarchical structure
- Language-specific navigation

## Tag and Category System
- Defined in `content/common/tagsandcategories.json`
- Used for filtering and organizing content
- Referenced in DOC-META and SEC-META sections

## AI Model References
- Available AI models defined in `content/common/ai_models.json`
- Used to document which AI models were used in content creation
- Referenced in DOC-META metadata

## Open Graph Support
- Default images for each language
- Content-specific images can be defined in DOC-META
- Image paths are relative to the public directory

## Language-Specific Content Trees
- Each language has its own independent content structure
- Translations are managed separately
- Navigation structure can vary between languages

## Image and Media Management
- Media files stored in `public/content/media/`
- Language-specific media in `public/content/{lang}/media/`
- Referenced in Markdown with relative paths

## Content Creation Guidelines
- Follow the document metadata guidelines in `doc-metadata.mdc`
- Ensure consistent structure and formatting
- Use appropriate tags and categories
- Include necessary metadata for SEO and sharing
