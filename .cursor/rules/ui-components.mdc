# UI Component Guidelines

## General Principles
- Components should be minimalistic and functional.
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard support, focus handling).
- Ensure responsiveness and mobile compatibility.
- Animations should be smooth and unobtrusive.

## Action Menu
- Floats in the bottom-left corner.
- Automatically adjusts position when the footer is visible.
- Uses smooth hover-based activation.
- Fully keyboard and touch accessible.
- Animated transitions with staged item reveal.
- Intelligent `z-index` management to avoid overlap issues.

## Theme & Language Selection
- Right-aligned toggles in the header.
- Uses system preferences as the default.
- Ensures persistent user choices.
- Fully keyboard accessible.
- Optimized touch targets for mobile.

## Interaction Design
- Buttons should have clear hover and active states.
- Transitions should be subtle (e.g., `ease-in-out`, `200ms`).
- Avoid excessive animations that distract from content.
