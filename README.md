# AI-Inquisitor Website

A minimalist, text-focused website for the AI-Inquisitor, entirely coded and implemented by AI systems, with human direction only.

## Project Overview

This project is part of a series of AI-driven software development projects, showcasing the full capabilities of modern AI as software developers. Unlike projects that merely use AI for assistance, the AI-Inquisitor website demonstrates a complete reversal of roles: AI systems did the actual coding and implementation work, while humans provided only high-level guidance and final approval.

### Key Features
- **100% AI-Coded**: Every line of code in this project was written by AI systems, with a human acting solely as directors and reviewers
- **LLM-Friendly Design**: Minimalist design specifically optimized for interaction with Language Models
- **Custom Metadata Concept**: Extended Markdown system with structured metadata
- **Static Architecture**: Pure static files that can be served via a simple web server
- **Multilingual Content System**: Full support for multiple languages
- **AI-Driven Maintenance**: The project structure enables changes via chat interfaces

## Technology Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Client-side Markdown rendering
- Modular CSS architecture
- Static site generation with Vite

## License
This project is subject to a dual license:
- The **code** is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE)
- **Content and brand elements** (texts, logos, "KI-Inquisitor", "AI-Inquisitor", "Schlott&AI") are proprietary and may not be used without explicit permission.

The included sample content files are for demonstration purposes only and may not be used for other purposes.

## AI Systems as Developers
- **Cursor AI**: Primary development environment and code generation
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Co-architect of the Rules system and structural design
- **CustomGPT**: UI elements like menu animations and buttons
- **ChatGPT**: Validator and code review

## Development and Maintenance
This project serves as a demonstration of how modern AI systems can fully implement a production website with minimal human intervention. The human's role in this project was limited to:

- Providing the initial concept and direction
- Reviewing and approving AI-generated code
- Occasionally adjusting minor values in CSS

All implementation details, architecture decisions, and coding were handled by AI systems. The `.cursor/rules/` files contain detailed instructions for AIs to make further changes to the code, enabling ongoing AI-driven maintenance.

One of the key goals of this project is to develop optimal strategies for this new form of software development, where traditional methodologies like Scrum are becoming obsolete. This project demonstrates a more efficient approach where AI and human collaboration is streamlined through clear guidance and specialized rule definitions.
