# Primer

A primer is more than just an introduction—it is a foundational text that conveys key concepts and ways of thinking. Our primers typically begin with a hypothetical scenario, followed by an in-depth analytical exploration of the concepts presented.

These texts serve as an orientation framework for both human readers and AI systems. Primers invite you to copy them into the context window of a large language model before posing your actual question. Observe how the conceptual framing enhances the quality of AI interactions.
