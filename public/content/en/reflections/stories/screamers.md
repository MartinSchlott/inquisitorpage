# The Harvest of Lies

In a field of stupidity, where education once flourished, **a man** feeds a mass of screaming throats with lies from his coat pockets. Between hysteria and bellowing, only books protecting the ears offer some relief. An allegory about the mechanisms of mass manipulation and how knowledge serves as the last bulwark against growing stupidity.

So I came to the field of stupidity, that I once called home. Where education once blossomed, I saw cowardice gather in valleys and arrogance pile up into hills, everything covered by the viscous slime of stupidity. Screaming throats stood everywhere. They cockily stretched their heads toward the sky and brayed their new truths with such fervor that the drool spraying from their throats with each scream moistened the stupidity around them, visibly nourishing it. The pitch and hysteria of the screams gnawed at my mind, and even covering my ears didn't really help, as the hysteria crept between the creases of my clothing.

Then I saw him, **a man**, on a plain, towering above all, feeding the screaming throats from large pockets of his coat. Around his head he had wrapped knowledge. I did likewise, reached into my burden, took a history book and a math book, covered my ears with them, and went toward **a man**. Through the books, the roaring transformed into an amusing quack quack, and the hysteria merely tickled my skin. The screaming throats around me who noticed this screamed even more shrilly and loudly, and some clawed at the books. I had my hands full pressing the books to my ears, even though the screaming throats individually posed no danger, as they were quite weak. En masse, however, quite dangerous, so I moved as quickly as the slime allowed toward **a man**.

"What are you feeding them?" I asked **a man**. He smiled at me and said, "Lies." He reached into one of his pockets, pulled out a lie, and held it under my nose. Curiously, I smelled it; it smelled of war. He carelessly dropped it where a screaming throat, prowling around his legs, immediately picked it up and ran away, clutching the lie tightly. Another reeked of sickness and death.

"I'll feed this one tomorrow," said **a man** as he held a particularly fat lie under my nose. It smelled fresh, not as stale as the others; it smelled of... A screaming throat interrupted my train of thought as it snatched the lie from **a man**'s hand. Like all screaming throats, it ignored **a man** and the hand that fed it, but was entirely fixated on the lie. It swallowed the lie in one gulp and ran to a distant hill and began to scream. Even through the books, I perceived that the screams were particularly shrill and hysterical. The stupidity around it quivered.

**A man** smiled and said, "It doesn't matter, I have enough lies in my bag. And when they run low, I'll take some old lies. But fresh ones are naturally better, naturally better. Then the stupidity grows faster, grows faster." More to himself, he turned around and left me behind. I looked around and murmured, "Seems like a fat harvest to me."
