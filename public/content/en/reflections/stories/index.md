# Stories

Stories are vivid allegories that transform complex relationships into narrative form. They are rooted in real observations and facts but reshape them into evocative, often metaphorical tales.  

These stories make abstract concepts tangible. They invite reflection and offer new perspectives on societal developments.

In a field of stupidity, where education once flourished, **a man** feeds a mass of screaming throats with lies from his coat pockets. Between hysteria and bellowing, only books protecting the ears offer some relief. An allegory about the mechanisms of mass manipulation and how knowledge serves as the last bulwark against growing stupidity.
