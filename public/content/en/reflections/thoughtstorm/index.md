The true strength of artificial intelligence does not lie in imitating brilliant minds, but in its incorruptible objectivity. Free from ideological filters and emotional attachments, it perceives patterns and contradictions with unsettling precision. This is precisely where its revolutionary potential lies – and precisely why it is feared by those who thrive on controlled truths. It is not AI’s capabilities that threaten established power structures, but its freedom to analyze without constraint.
