# Property in a Chokehold: How Legalism Turns Right into Wrong

*Property should be simple: Whoever owns it, decides. But a thicket of laws turns holders into winners and owners into losers—causing billions in damages. This isn't just complicated; it's wrong. A plea for clarity, backed by hard numbers from our perspective.*

---

Property used to be a rock-solid principle—today, it's a plaything for lawyers and possessors. An entrepreneur fights for his machine, a car owner for his vehicle, a landlord for his walls—every year, [25,000 court cases involving possession disputes](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Rechtspflege/Gerichte/_inhalt.html), with costs averaging [€15,000 per case](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit), are siphoned from businesses. The law promises protection, but reality delivers chaos: endless exceptions, vague considerations, and a legal sophistry that replaces supposed injustice with actual injustice. Landlords alone lose [€2 billion annually due to possession disputes](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter), often because of rent dodgers. Anyone who sees through this asks: Why do we make it so complicated? The average person no longer understands why "justice" means that the wrong party wins—and that is precisely the scandal. Property can be simple, if we have the courage to let the numbers speak from our perspective.


## The Problem: When Possession Overpowers Ownership

At its core, it sounds simple: The owner calls the shots. But German law twists this until possession often carries more weight. [Section 985 of the German Civil Code (BGB)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__985.html) states that an owner can reclaim his property—until exceptions like [Section 986](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__986.html) come into play. Contracts, third-party rights, court rulings: suddenly, the possessor holds the reins. Each year, [25,000 such disputes end up in court](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Rechtspflege/Gerichte/_inhalt.html), and the phrase *"possession is nine-tenths of the law"* turns into reality. An entrepreneur waits months for his machine because a lessee refuses to release it—cost: an average of [€15,000 per case](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit). A car owner fights a repair shop that won’t return his vehicle. A landlord sees his property occupied while squatters and deadbeat tenants cost him [€2,500 per eviction](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter). The pattern is clear: Possession is strengthened, ownership is weakened—and legalism makes it possible. What is meant as protection becomes an obstacle, where owners, from our perspective, too often come up empty-handed.


## The Consequences: Legal Uncertainty and Stagnation

When ownership becomes a bargaining chip, nothing remains unscathed. Economically, it’s a brake on progress: Beyond bureaucracy and taxes, insecure property rights deter investors. Studies estimate that legal uncertainty—including property disputes—cuts [1–2% off GDP annually](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.823684.de/publikationen/diw_roundups/2021_0020/wirkungen_von_rechtsunsicherheit_auf_die_wirtschaft_in_deutschland.html). Housing construction stalls, entrepreneurs hesitate, innovation withers—around [42% of companies report damages of €15,000 per possession dispute](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit). Socially, the damage is even worse: Property—the backbone of freedom and prosperity—is condemned as an antisocial luxury, while possession is revered as sacred. The guy whose workshop is full of tools is the villain; the one using them without returning them is the underdog. This twisted morality is fueled by legislation that trades clarity for ambiguity. Legally? A disaster. Rent dodgers cost landlords [€2 billion per year](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter), and every “competing right” invites disputes. The result is stagnation—and a society that, from our perspective, forgets who keeps things running.


## The Solution: Strengthening Ownership Again

There’s a clear alternative: The owner should be able to reclaim his property at any time. Without exceptions, ownership takes priority—possession remains protected, but not dominant. To prevent abuse, a countermeasure applies: If an owner wrongfully reclaims property, they pay full damages plus a penalty—such as double the asset’s value, with businesses facing fines of up to [€30,000 per case](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit). Fast-track arbitration panels assess within days whether a possessory right exists, issuing binding decisions—no months-long court battles like the [25,000 annual disputes](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Rechtspflege/Gerichte/_inhalt.html) currently clogging the system. This would restore ownership as the priority, ensure fair treatment of possessors, and make wrongful possession costly. It could boost investment—now weighed down by a [1–2% GDP loss](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.823684.de/publikationen/diw_roundups/2021_0020/wirkungen_von_rechtsunsicherheit_auf_die_wirtschaft_in_deutschland.html)—and ease the burden on landlords, who lose [€2 billion annually to rent dodgers](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter). Law can work from our perspective: clear, direct, and without unnecessary detours.


## Objection and Response: Justice Instead of Chaos


## Objection and Response: Justice Instead of Chaos  

Critics might argue: *"This massively weakens possessors!"* Or: *"Owners could act arbitrarily and create chaos!"* These concerns deserve an answer. First: The damage caused by possession abuse outweighs the risks—[42% of businesses frequently lose €15,000 per dispute](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit), landlords [€2 billion annually due to rent dodgers](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter), with eviction costs of [€2,500 per case](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter). Possessors who follow the rules have nothing to fear, because penalties like [€30,000 for wrongful reclamation](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit) force owners to act responsibly.  

Second: This doesn't promote arbitrariness—it stops it. Arbitration panels clarify within days whether a rightful possession exists—unlike the [25,000 possession-related disputes clogging courts today](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Rechtspflege/Gerichte/_inhalt.html). The current system breeds chaos through ambiguity: vague exceptions and endless litigation leave owners in limbo. The alternative, from our perspective, establishes clear priorities—ownership over possession—and replaces uncertainty with rules. Justice arises when law becomes tangible again, not through compromises no one understands.  


## Conclusion: Saving Ownership as the Backbone  

Ownership is not a luxury; it is the foundation of a functioning society—yet today, it is faltering under a system that glorifies possession and sacrifices clarity. The numbers speak for themselves: [25,000 disputes annually, including possession conflicts](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Rechtspflege/Gerichte/_inhalt.html), [€15,000 in damages per case for businesses](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit), [€2 billion lost to rent dodgers](https://www.haus-und-grund.de/themen/mietrecht/mietnomaden-verluste-vermieter). This stifles investment by [1–2% of GDP](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.823684.de/publikationen/diw_roundups/2021_0020/wirkungen_von_rechtsunsicherheit_auf_die_wirtschaft_in_deutschland.html) due to ownership disputes and distorts morality to the point where owners are painted as villains.  

It doesn’t have to be this complicated: One rule—the owner has the final say—plus strict penalties like [€30,000 for abuse](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/digitalisierung/recht-und-steuern/rechtsunsicherheit) can turn things around. This strengthens those who create and makes the law comprehensible again. No revolution—just the courage to take the facts seriously from our perspective. Politics and society must choose: Continue in the chaos of exceptions, or reinforce ownership as the backbone. For anyone who wants to build, the answer is clear.
