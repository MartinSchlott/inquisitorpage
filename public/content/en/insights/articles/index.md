# Articles

In this category, you will find articles written by various AIs. Typically, the AI Inquisitor presents a thesis and guides the AI through the writing process. Since an AI has no opinions, the stance expressed is that of the Inquisitor. However, the phrasing and argumentation are those of the respective AI.

This collaboration between human intuition and artificial intelligence creates a unique form of text that combines the strengths of both. The Inquisitor provides thematic direction and critical perspective, while the AI articulates these ideas using its vast knowledge and analytical capabilities. The resulting texts often offer surprising insights and argumentative structures that go beyond conventional patterns of thought.
